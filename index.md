<h2>Hello and welcome to this brief documentation about dynamic-forms project :blush:</h2> 

The general idea was creating a software to develop forms in a dynamically way, like google forms!<br>
<b>Consider that this is only the editor part of the whole idea...</b><br>
So lets imagine you want to create a form with it's title, subtitle and a short description for information purpose<br>
and then you want to divide the form into what i call sections (group of inputs for displaying data into individual panels, like a wizard..)<br>
so every section contains as many fields as you want, every field represents an input for the user <br>




<h2> Let's see some images about the software :camera:</h2>

Login page (displaying some personal info at the top..)

![03 Login](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10009918/122457360-f18b4100-cf84-11eb-98d7-2bc4d4c58211.png)

My profile picture displayed

![02 Login](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10009918/122457601-331bec00-cf85-11eb-9c3b-2626a8b1a41c.png)

Once you logged in! (A header for logout is displayed and you are redirected to forms page)

![01 forms](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10009918/122457990-ad4c7080-cf85-11eb-8602-e2d98e2d1e92.png)

If you create a new form or just update an existing one you will see the next page (Form tab default selected)

![01 form](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10009918/122458285-074d3600-cf86-11eb-853a-c3f19c358854.png)

Once you clicked at <i>Sections Tab</i> and you want to add a new one

![02 form](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10009918/122572662-55187b80-d024-11eb-82c6-5834260a83d1.png)

![03 form](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10009918/122572889-914bdc00-d024-11eb-99bd-1c3b841193b0.png)

Is not only responsible it also re-arranges the visual as you see below

![04 form](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10009918/122459086-e20cf780-cf86-11eb-98bb-7ed3a6337f63.png)

When clicking update's link at the section --> 

![01 field](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10009918/122459302-28faed00-cf87-11eb-82d2-44f45332dbef.png)

When you add or update an existing field

And this is how you delete one

<span>
  This a react project that integrates libraries such as react-router-dom for the routing, <br>
  redux for login state with a little help from localStorage for keeping<br>
  the session alive while re-directing the user among different pages, react-bootstrap to build some nice components and axios for
  communication with the api rest.
</span>

<span>
  The backend of this project is created with Ruby on rails, at the beginning i use rails-react gem to build the whole project, but then i decided to separate 
  react and leave rails as a rest api only.
